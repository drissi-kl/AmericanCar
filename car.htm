                Let's talk about classic American muscle cars. While some consider them merely machines,
                 others may think of them as cherished family members. We think everyone can find joy in 
                 the high-horsepower shenanigans that both vintage and new performance cars deliver.
                A muscle car has American roots, purpose-built for straight-line performance, 
                and targeted at young buyers. These cars were built on an intermediate body style in 
                the mid to late 60s and early 70s, featuring two doors, front and rear seats, and a 
                high-performance V8 engine
