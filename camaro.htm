                <p>In a segment full of burbling American muscle, the Chevy Camaro ZL1 proves stereotypes are as good as garbage thanks to its great handling, sharp steering, and stonking powertrain. Beneath the hood is a 650-hp supercharged pushrod V-8 borrowed from the last-generation C7 Corvette Z06. Rear-wheel drive is standard, but the ZL1 and zanier ZL1 1LE are each offered with either a six-speed manual or 10-speed automatic transmission. While a convertible is available with either transmission, only the ZL1 coupe is eligible for the 1LE track performance package that adds an adjustable suspension, extreme performance tires, and carbon fiber goodiesâ€”and even goes as far as deleting the rear seats. This is a Camaro on steroids but it won't be around for much longer, as Chevy announced production of its storied muscle car will end January 2024.</p>
